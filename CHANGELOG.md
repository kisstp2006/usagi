# Changelog

History of Usagi releases and what changed in each release. User-facing notes.
Doesn't contain updates relating to developing the engine itself.

## UNRELEASED

Features:

- Multiple Lua source files are now supported; use `require("file")` to load
  `file.lua`.
- Compound assignment operators: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` are rewritten to
  plain Lua before parsing, with `runtime.nonstandardSymbol` set in the shipped
  `.luarc.json` so the language server accepts them.

## v0.1.0 - Apr 27, 2026

Initial release of Usagi, introducing the CLI with `usagi dev`, `usagi run`,
`usagi export`, and `usagi run`.

Includes input, rectangle drawing, sound effect playback, and rendering tiles
from a single `sprites.png.`

Features:

- `gfx.rect` now draws a rectangle outline; use `gfx.rect_fill` for the filled
  variant
- `gfx.circ(x, y, r, color)` — circle outline
- `gfx.circ_fill(x, y, r, color)` — filled circle
- `gfx.line(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)` — line
- Ctrl + R and Cmd + R hard refresh in `usagi dev`
- `usagi export` produces every platform from any host. Default output is
  `export/` containing zips for linux, macos, windows, web, plus the portable
  `.usagi` bundle.
- `--target` accepts `linux`, `macos`, `windows`, `web`, `bundle`, or `all`.
- Runtime templates auto-fetch by version from GitHub Releases on first use,
  cache to a per-OS directory, and verify against published `sha256` sidecars
  before extracting.
- Host platform exports offline (fuses against the running binary, no cache
  lookup or network).
- New flags: `--template-path` (local archive), `--template-url` (custom URL,
  useful for forks and mirrors), `--no-cache` (force re-download), `--web-shell`
  (custom HTML shell for the web export).
- Custom web shell auto-pickup: `<project>/shell.html` is used if present.
- New subcommand `usagi templates {list,clear}` to inspect or wipe the cache.
- Set `USAGI_TEMPLATE_BASE` to point at a fork or mirror for offline /
  air-gapped setups.
- `usagi init [path]` bootstraps a new project. Writes `main.lua` with stubbed
  callbacks, `.luarc.json` for Lua LSP, `.gitignore`, `meta/usagi.lua` (API type
  stubs for editor autocomplete), and `USAGI.md` (engine docs). Defaults to the
  current directory; existing files are skipped, never overwritten.

# Developing usagi

Guide to how to work on the engine.

## Style

The Rust code uses the default styles from `cargo fmt`.

Pull requests will be renamed to follow
[the Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Lua style

- 2 spaces for indentation. `snake_case` for locals, function names, table
  fields, and helper module names (e.g. `enemy.lua`, `local fresh_state`).
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for compile-time-ish constants (file-scope
  `local TICK = 0.12`, `local MAX_BULLETS = 12`, the engine's `gfx.COLOR_*`
  table). Distinguishes "tunable knob" from "runtime variable."
- Engine API is lowercase (`gfx`, `input`, `sfx`, `music`, `usagi`). It's
  declared in `meta/usagi.lua` so the LSP treats it as predefined; reads in user
  code don't trip `lowercase-global`.
- **Cross-frame globals are `Capitalized`.** This includes the canonical
  game-state container (`State = { ... }` set inside `_init`) and module imports
  kept as globals (`Player = require("player")`). The capitalization signals
  "intentional global, lives across reloads"; anything lowercase at file scope
  is treated by `lowercase-global` as an accident (forgot a `local`).
- Why `State` is a global: live reload re-execs the chunk on every saved edit. A
  `local State` at module scope would get re-bound to a fresh table every save
  and obliterate the running game. Setting `State` in `_init` (and only in
  `_init`, which only runs at startup and on F5) lets the table outlive reloads.
- If you have a real cross-frame need that isn't `State`, the convention scales:
  capitalize and document it. Module-bound require results (`Enemy`, `Bullet`)
  are the common second case.

This pattern (engine-API lowercase / game-state capitalized / locals snake_case)
is the same one shipped in `.luarc.json` and the `usagi init` template, and is
what every example under `examples/` follows.

## Dependencies

Install Rust: https://rustup.rs

### Windows build prerequisites

Use the **MSVC** toolchain (`stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). The `gnu`
toolchain is not supported: it lacks `dlltool.exe`, which other deps in our tree
require, and switching does not fix the zlib issue below.

The `usagi font bake` subcommand brings in `freetype-rs` with vendored FreeType.
FreeType's bundled build compiles libpng, which `#include`s `zlib.h`, and
freetype-sys 0.23.0 doesn't expose zlib's include path properly on Windows.

Install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) (the Microsoft C/C++ package manager), then
install zlib and point `cl` at it before building:

```pwsh
vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows-static-md
$env:CFLAGS_x86_64_pc_windows_msvc = "-IC:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows-static-md\include"
cargo build
```

Linux and macOS find a usable zlib path automatically and don't need this step.
The canonical reference for the Windows setup is the
`Install Windows zlib for freetype-sys` step in
[ci.yml](https://github.com/brettchalupa/usagi/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

### Third-party licenses

`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` is generated from `Cargo.lock` by
[cargo-about](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) and committed. It's
regenerated as part of release prep, not on every CI run: cargo-about picks one
"representative" LICENSE file per SPDX group and the pick varies between
environments, so a CI sync check produces flaky diffs that don't reflect real
problems. Run it locally before tagging a release:

```sh
cargo install cargo-about --features cli  # one-time
just licenses
git diff THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md          # review
```

The accepted-licenses list lives in `about.toml`. If a new dep brings in a
license that's not in the list, cargo-about errors; add the SPDX ID after
eyeballing the terms, or replace the dep.

## Docs

Documentation is written in Markdown. It's formatted with `deno fmt`, but it's
not a huge deal if there's drift there, so CI doesn't enforce this.

Changes to the README should be made in `README_DEV.md`, which is used to stage
docs for the next release. The `README.md` is for the most recently released
version of Usagi, so that when people come to GitHub they don't see
documentation for features that aren't in a shipped version yet.

Only update `README.md` too when fixing a typo or adding something that's not
version-specific.

`CHANGELOG.md` contains a list of changes for each version. Pre-release notes
get squashed into the full release when it happens.

## Local

After cloning, run `just setup` once. It points git at `.githooks/`, so
`just ok` runs automatically before every push (skip with `--no-verify` in a
pinch).

`just ok` runs fmt, clippy, and tests. Run before any commit.

`just example <name>` boots an example in dev mode with live reload.

While developing Usagi itself, replace `usagi` with `cargo run --` (for example
`cargo run -- dev examples/hello_usagi.lua`).

`just build-web` then `just serve-web` builds the wasm runtime and serves it
locally on port 3535. Needs emscripten on PATH; run
`./scripts/setup_emscripten.sh` once to install it on Fedora.
`brew install emscripten` works on macOS.

See `justfile` for the full list of recipes.

## Developing

- `just run` - run hello_usagi example
- `just ok` - run all checks
- `just fmt` - format Rust code
- `just serve-web` - build and serve the web build at <http://localhost:3535>
  (requires `emcc` on PATH; see [docs/web-build.md](docs/web-build.md))

## Adding Lua API bindings

Every Rust callback exposed to user Lua (anything registered with
`lua.create_function` or `scope.create_function` and assigned onto `gfx`,
`input`, `sfx`, `music`, `usagi`, `effect`, etc.) MUST go through the `wrap`
helper in `src/api.rs` before being attached to its public table.

Pattern:

```rust
let raw = lua.create_function(|_, c: i32| { /* ... */ })?;
gfx.set("clear", wrap(lua, raw, "gfx.clear", &["number"])?)?;
```

`types` is a slice of expected `type()` strings (`"number"`, `"string"`,
`"boolean"`, `"function"`, `"table"`, `"nil"`, or `"any"` to skip a check). The
wrapper calls `error(...)` from Lua-land when validation fails.

### Why this is mandatory

Lua's only error mechanism is `lua_error`, which is `longjmp`. When a Rust
callback returns `Err`, mlua re-raises via `lua_error`, and the longjmp has to
unwind back to the nearest `lua_pcall`, crossing every Rust frame on the way. On
Windows MSVC that trips the GS stack-cookie check and aborts the process with
`STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`. See
[#103](https://github.com/brettchalupa/usagi/issues/103).

The wrapper sidesteps this by validating in Lua-land first. When a user calls
`gfx.clear(nil)`, the validator's `error(...)` originates from Lua's `error`
builtin, so the longjmp traverses Lua/C frames only and lands safely at the
outer pcall on every platform.

This applies to BOTH stable callbacks (registered once at session start) and
per-frame scoped callbacks inside `lua.scope` blocks. The wrap call goes inside
the scope alongside the `scope.create_function` call.

If the new binding accepts something mlua's typed conversion can't easily
express (an `Option<T>`, a serializable `LuaValue`, a multi-type union), use
`"any"` for that arg and let the Rust closure handle the variant.

There are regression tests in `src/api.rs` (`wrap_rejects_bad_arg_*`) that lock
the contract in place.

## Testing the Web Build Locally

`usagi export --target web` normally fetches a runtime template from the
matching release tag. On a `-dev` build there's no published release, so point
the CLI at the locally-built runtime instead. `--template-path` accepts an
extracted directory in addition to an archive:

```sh
just build-web                          # one-time: build the wasm runtime
cargo run -- export examples/snake --target web \
    --template-path target/wasm32-unknown-emscripten/release
```

That writes `snake-web.zip` in the cwd. To run it in a browser:

```sh
unzip -d /tmp/snake-web snake-web.zip
simple-http-server --index --nocache -p 3535 /tmp/snake-web
# open http://localhost:3535
```

`simple-http-server` is the same server `just serve-web` uses (installed by
`just setup-web`).

`shell.html` is auto-picked up from `web/shell.html` in the source tree when
running from the repo root, so you don't need to stage it. Pass
`--web-shell PATH` (or drop a `shell.html` next to your script) to use a custom
one.

`just push-web-test EXAMPLE_NAME` can be used to push an example game's web
build to a private testing project on itch.io to ensure web builds work. Best
used with `notetris`.

## CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Runs on every push to `main` and every pull request. Three jobs:

- `check`: matrix of Linux (`ubuntu-22.04`), macOS (`macos-latest`, Apple
  Silicon), and Windows (`windows-latest`). Runs fmt, clippy, tests, and a
  release build. Uploads the binary as an artifact.
- `web`: builds the emscripten wasm runtime. Uploads `usagi.js` and
  `usagi.wasm`.

CI artifacts expire after 90 days and require a GitHub login to download. Use
them for spot-checking a PR. For distribution, cut a release.

## Releases (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

### Release Prep

1. Run `just ok` to ensure all checks pass
2. Run `just examples` to verify everything is working as expected
3. Test syntax error recovery in a `require` to ensure it works
4. Test `usagi tools`
5. Verify web builds work with `just push-web-test notetris` and test at
   [https://brettchalupa.itch.io/usagi-web-test](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/usagi-web-test)
6. Verify gamepads work
7. Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml` and run `cargo update -p usagi` to refresh
   `Cargo.lock` before tagging. The tag should match the manifest version
8. Run `just licenses` to regenerate `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` from the current
   `Cargo.lock`. Review the diff and commit it. (See
   [Third-party licenses](#third-party-licenses) for setup.)
9. Update the current version in README_DEV.md
10. Update CHANGELOG.md
11. `cp README_DEV.md README.md`

### Tagging

Push a tag matching `v*` to trigger a release build:

```sh
git tag -a v0.1.0
# paste in the changelog into the tag
git push origin v0.1.0
```

### Publishing the Release

The workflow builds release binaries on every supported target, packages them,
and creates a GitHub Release **as a draft** with the archives attached. Once the
workflow finishes, there will be a draft release.

Copy the Changelog notes and assets on the Releases page, then click Publish to
make it public. Tags containing a hyphen (`v0.1.0-rc.1`) are flagged as
prereleases following semver convention.

### Release Artifacts

| File                               | Target                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `usagi-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`  | Linux x86_64, glibc 2.35+                            |
| `usagi-<ver>-macos-aarch64.tar.gz` | macOS, Apple Silicon                                 |
| `usagi-<ver>-windows-x86_64.zip`   | Windows 10+                                          |
| `usagi-<ver>-wasm.tar.gz`          | Web runtime (`usagi.js` + `usagi.wasm` + shell.html) |

Each artifact also publishes a `<file>.sha256` sidecar (sha256sum format).
`usagi export` fetches the sidecar alongside the archive and verifies before
extraction; mismatches fail loudly.

Filenames carry the architecture so future arm/x86 splits drop in without
renaming. `usagi export` resolves `--target linux` to the matching artifact via
the URL convention `${USAGI_TEMPLATE_BASE}/v<ver>/<file>`.

### Update itch.io

1. `just push-itch`
2. Publish a devlog with the changes

### Post Release

Share the release:

- Bluesky
- Mastodon
- r/UsagiEngine
- YouTube post
- Discord

Push a new version of notetris to itch.io: `./examples/notetris/push.rb`

After the release is made, bump the version in `Cargo.toml` to the next version
that will be worked on and add the `-dev` suffix. So if `v1.1.0` was just
released, update it to `1.2.0-dev` and run `cargo update -p usagi`. Commit and
push this to GitHub. This helps make it clear that what's on `main` is not the
published version nor the upcoming version (yet).

## Build Environment Notes

- The Linux runner is `ubuntu-22.04` (glibc 2.35) for portability. Binaries
  should run on Debian 12+, RHEL 9+, Fedora, Arch, openSUSE Leap 15.4+.
- `macos-latest` is Apple Silicon. No Intel mac binary is produced.

## Web Build (wasm32-unknown-emscripten) Notes

The non-obvious bits of getting Usagi to compile and link for the web. If the
web build breaks, start here.

### Toolchain

- Stable Rust (currently 1.95.0 verified). No `rust-toolchain.toml` pin.
- Emscripten via emsdk. `scripts/setup_emscripten.sh` installs to
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/emsdk` (or `~/.local/share/emsdk`); source
  `~/.local/share/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh` to put `emcc` on `PATH`. On macOS, you can
  do `brew install emscripten`.
- emcc 5.0.6 verified.

Build with `just build-web` (or `just build-web-release`).

### The wasm exception ABI: what you need to know

Rust 1.93+ unconditionally passes `-fwasm-exceptions` to emcc when targeting
`wasm32-unknown-emscripten`. This was [rust-lang/rust#147224][r147224]. The
older `panic = "abort"`-disables-it advice from blog posts and Stack Overflow no
longer applies: rustc emits `-fwasm-exceptions` regardless of panic strategy
because the prebuilt stable sysroot is itself built with wasm-eh (see
[rust-lang/rust#135450][r135450]).

That means _every_ C/C++ object file in the link must also use the wasm-eh ABI.
If anything is built with the legacy JS-EH ABI, the link fails with undefined
symbols like `__cxa_find_matching_catch_3`.

[r147224]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/147224
[r135450]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135450

#### Three places to keep in sync

1. **rustc link args** in `.cargo/config.toml` rustflags:
   `-C link-arg=-sSUPPORT_LONGJMP=wasm`. emcc rejects
   `SUPPORT_LONGJMP=emscripten` (the legacy setjmp ABI) when wasm-eh is on, so
   we use the wasm-native pairing. mlua's vendored Lua uses setjmp for error
   handling, which is why this matters.
2. **cc-rs CFLAGS** in `.cargo/config.toml` `[env]`:
   `CFLAGS_wasm32_unknown_emscripten` and `CXXFLAGS_wasm32_unknown_emscripten`
   set to `-fwasm-exceptions -sSUPPORT_LONGJMP=wasm`. cc-rs reads these when
   compiling C deps for the target, including mlua's vendored Lua.
3. **emcc CFLAGS** via `EMCC_CFLAGS` in the justfile recipes:
   `-fwasm-exceptions -sSUPPORT_LONGJMP=wasm` (alongside the raylib port flags).
   raylib's CMake build is invoked through emcc directly, bypassing cc-rs, so it
   needs the same flags via `EMCC_CFLAGS`.

If you change one of these, change them together. A mismatch shows up as either
a `__cxa_find_matching_catch_*` undefined symbol error (some object file used
JS-EH ABI) or as a
`SUPPORT_LONGJMP=emscripten is not compatible
with -fwasm-exceptions` rejection
(legacy longjmp ABI).

#### What `panic = "abort"` is and isn't doing

The `[profile.dev]` and `[profile.release]` `panic = "abort"` settings in
`Cargo.toml` are there for binary size, on all targets. They are NOT what makes
the web build link. (The 2024-era articles claiming panic=abort disables
`-fwasm-exceptions` are stale; that path was removed.)

Cargo automatically uses `panic = "unwind"` for the test profile, so
`cargo test` is unaffected by these settings.

### Frame loop

Usagi's wasm build uses `emscripten_set_main_loop_arg` (not ASYNCIFY). The
browser drives the per-frame body at requestAnimationFrame rate. ASYNCIFY was
tried earlier and rejected because it conflicts with `-fwasm-exceptions` and
adds runtime overhead. The session struct owns all per-frame state so it can
hand a single `&mut Session` to emscripten's main loop.

### Game data: runtime is decoupled from the game

The wasm runtime is game-agnostic. It does NOT have a game baked in via
`--preload-file`. Instead:

1. The JS shell (`web/shell.html`) fetches `game.usagi` (overridable via
   `window.USAGI_BUNDLE_URL`) over HTTP after the runtime initializes.
2. JS writes the bytes into the wasm virtual FS at `/game.usagi` using
   `Module.FS.writeFile` (which is why `FS` is in `EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS`).
3. JS calls `Module.callMain([])`. Rust's `main()` on the emscripten target
   loads `/game.usagi`, builds a `BundleBacked` vfs, and runs.

This is the same `.usagi` bundle format `usagi export --target bundle` produces
on native. So the build artifacts in `target/web/` are:

| File         | Role                                     | Game-specific? |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `index.html` | Shell with click-to-play overlay         | No             |
| `usagi.js`   | Emscripten loader / glue                 | No             |
| `usagi.wasm` | Usagi runtime                            | No             |
| `game.usagi` | Bundled `main.lua` + `sprites.png` + sfx | **Yes**        |

To swap games you only need to replace `game.usagi`; the other three files are
reusable across games. That's also what makes `usagi export --target web` viable
without an emcc rebuild on the user's machine.

### Developing and testing examples in the browser

Quickstart:

1. One-time setup (per machine):
   - `bash scripts/setup_emscripten.sh` (installs emsdk to
     `~/.local/share/emsdk`).
   - `just setup-web` (adds the wasm target and a tiny static server).
2. Each new shell session, source emsdk so `emcc` is on PATH:
   ```sh
   source ~/.local/share/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
   ```
3. Build + serve at `http://localhost:3535`:
   ```sh
   just serve-web
   ```
   Or just build (no server):
   ```sh
   just build-web        # debug
   just build-web-release # release, much smaller, no source maps
   ```

#### Running a different example

The runtime in `target/web/` is game-agnostic. To swap the game without
rebuilding the runtime:

```sh
just example-web spr           # rebundles examples/spr -> target/web/game.usagi
# refresh the browser tab
```

This works for any path that `usagi export --target bundle` accepts: a directory
with a `main.lua`, a single `.lua` file, etc. If you change something in the
bundled game's source, rerun `just example-web <name>` and refresh.

Skip `just build-web` between examples; the runtime is identical across games.

### Click-to-play overlay

`web/shell.html` shows a "Click to play" overlay that holds `Module.main()`
until the user clicks. It does three things on click:

1. Fetches `game.usagi` over HTTP and writes it to the wasm virtual FS.
2. Resumes any suspended AudioContext (browsers gate audio behind a user
   gesture).
3. Calls `Module.callMain([])` to start the game.

`Module.noInitialRun = true` is used so emscripten doesn't auto-run main() the
moment the runtime initializes; the click handler drives it instead. The bundle
URL defaults to `game.usagi` (relative to the page); set
`window.USAGI_BUNDLE_URL` before loading `usagi.js` to override.
